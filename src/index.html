                The Sir Bani Yas Forum convenes invited guests to engage in
                frank and constructive discussions about the most pressing
                issues in the Middle East.
              </p>
              <p>
                Convened annually since 2010 under the ‘Chatham House Rule’ of
                non-attribution and held in a strictly private setting, the
                Forum’s program blends together insights from expert panel
                discussions and one-on-one interviews to provoke unscripted,
                dynamic, and substantive debate on a range of complex topics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal of the Forum is to create a private and confidential
                environment for senior-level discussions about peace and
                security in the Middle East. To this end, the Sir Bani Yas Forum
                strives to positively contribute to and advance dialogue on how
                the Middle East can evolve and adapt in a period of significant
                change and complexity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Participation at the Sir Bani Yas Forum is by invitation-only
                and admittance is not possible without the appropriate
                registration. There are no passes available for media to cover
                the event as the Sir Bani Yas Forum is entirely private and
                off-the-record.
