                  The Sir Bani Yas Forum is convened under the ‘Chatham House
                  Rule’ of non-attribution and held in a strictly confidential
                  setting. Therefore, participants are free to use any
                  information received throughout the Forum, but neither the
                  identity or affiliation of the speaker(s), that of any other
                  participant, may be revealed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Forum believes it is essential that all participants and
                  speakers are able to speak frankly and openly on the issues
                  currently facing the Middle East in a strictly confidential
                  environment. Through the implementation of the Chatham House
                  Rule, the Forum seeks to encourage participants to engage in
                  an environment of openness and trust.
