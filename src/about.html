                The Sir Bani Yas Forum convenes invited guests to engage in
                frank and constructive discussions about the most pressing
                issues in the Middle East.</strong

              Convened annually since 2010 under the ‘Chatham House Rule’ of
              non-attribution and held in a strictly private setting, the
              Forum’s program blends together insights from expert panel
              discussions and one-on-one interviews to provoke unscripted,
              dynamic, and substantive debate on a range of complex topics.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of the Forum is to create a private and confidential
              environment for senior-level discussions about peace and security
              in the Middle East. To this end, the Sir Bani Yas Forum strives to
              positively contribute to and advance dialogue on how the Middle
              East can evolve and adapt in a period of significant change and
              complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participation at the Sir Bani Yas Forum is by invitation-only and
              admittance is not possible without the appropriate registration.
              There are no passes available for media to cover the event as the
              Sir Bani Yas Forum is entirely private and off-the-record.
