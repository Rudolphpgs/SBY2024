                    The Sir Bani Yas Forum is convened under the ‘Chatham House
                    Rule’ of non-attribution and held in a strictly confidential
                    setting.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>What is the Chatham House Rule?</strong><br />
                    When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham
                    House Rule, participants are free to use the information
                    received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of
                    the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be
                    revealed.
                  </p>

                      >Why does the Sir Bani Yas Forum use the Chatham House
                      Rule?</strong
                    ><br />
                    The Forum believes that it is essential that all
                    participants and speakers are able to speak frankly and
                    openly on the issues currently facing the Middle East in a
                    strictly confidential environment. Through the
                    implementation of the Chatham House Rule, the Forum seeks to
                    encourage participants to engage in an environment of
                    openness and trust. Consequently, all participants are asked
                    to observe the Chatham House Rule whilst at the Forum in
                    order to facilitate the private and off-the-record nature of
                    the debates.
                  </p>

                      photos on social media during or after the event? </strong
                    ><br />
                    Twitter and other social media platforms can be used during
                    and after the Sir Bani Yas Forum. However, the person
                    tweeting or publishing online should not identify, either
                    directly or indirectly, any other speaker or participant at
                    the event. Photos taken at the event can be posted. However,
                    such photos should not include other speakers or
                    participants without their explicit permission and
                    knowledge.
