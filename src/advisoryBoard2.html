                    David Miliband is the President and CEO of the International
                    Rescue Committee (IRC). He oversees the agency’s relief and
                    development operations in over 30 countries, its refugee
                    resettlement and assistance programs throughout the United
                    States, and the IRC’s advocacy efforts in Washington and
                    other capitals on behalf of the world’s most vulnerable
                    people. Mr. Miliband has had a distinguished political
                    career in the United Kingdom. From 2007 to 2010, he served
                    as the youngest Foreign Secretary in three decades, driving
                    advancements in human rights and representing the United
                    Kingdom throughout the world. His accomplishments have
                    earned him a reputation, in former President Bill Clinton’s
                    words, as “one of the ablest, most creative public servants
                    of our time.” In 2016, Fortune Magazine named Mr. Miliband
                    one of the World’s Greatest Leaders. Mr. Miliband is also
                    the author of the book, “Rescue: Refugees and the Political
                    Crisis of Our Time.” As theson of refugees, Mr. Miliband
                    brings a personal commitment to the IRC’s work and to the
                    premise of the book: that we can rescue the dignity and
                    hopes of refugees and displaced people. And if we help them
                    ,in the process we will rescue our own values
