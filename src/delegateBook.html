                A Two-Speed Middle East: Regional Economic Transformation and

            <p>
              In the Middle East, there is a stark divide between the economies
              of affluent Gulf states and the struggling economies of several
              other regional countries, which are facing a potential storm of
              high-inflation, unemployment, and broader macro-economic
              stagnation. As one recent study found, though the Gulf states
              represented only 15 percent of the region's total population, it
              had almost half of the total regional income. This tale of two
              development speeds is evident in the significant disparities among
              these countries in terms of GDP per capita and unemployment rates,
              and raises complex questions of how regional states should
              understand and respond to it.
            </p>

            <p class="italic_ underline_">Prosperity in the Gulf</p>
            <p>
              With their vast oil and gas reserves and small populations (aside
              from Saudi Arabia), the Gulf states have a GDP per capita that
              rivals or surpasses that of many developed nations. The oil sector
              provided all Gulf countries with a strong starting point, and
              Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, and the United Arab
              Emirates have achieved significant advances in their living
              standards in just a few decades. Gulf sovereign wealth
              funds—valued at 3.7 trillion US dollars of assets by one analysis
              in early 2023—became tools for rapid diversification, providing
              access to advanced industries and tight integration with the
              global economy. More importantly, the expansion of other
              manufacturing and services sectors has helped Gulf states maintain
              growth despite slowdowns in the oil market.
            </p>
            <p>
              As global energy dynamics shift and the world transitions towards
              renewable sources, the Gulf states are working to reimagine their
              economic structures to ensure sustained prosperity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Saudi Arabia, the region's largest and fastest-growing G20 economy
              in 2022, has embarked on ambitious plans to transition away from
              oil dependence through its Vision 2030 initiative. By developing
              sectors such as tourism, technology, and entertainment, the
              Kingdom seeks to redefine its economic landscape. The UAE has been
              on a similar path for many years and is among the Gulf's most
              diversified economies. The UAE has become a global business and
              trade hub, attracting investment and talent from around the world;
              the country is also home to many multinational companies' regional
              headquarters.
            </p>

            <p class="italic_ underline_">States That Have Endured Conflict</p>

            <p>
              On the other end of the spectrum lie countries that have been
              consumed by conflict, such as Libya, Syria, and Yemen. These
              states face an uphill battle in restoring security, rebuilding
              infrastructure, and creating an environment conducive to economic
              rejuvenation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Libya, despite possessing significant natural resources (the
              country is ranked in the top ten globally for proven oil and gas
              reserves), has struggled to regain stability amid political
              fragmentation, persistent violent conflict, and the presence of
              competing armed groups. The country remains in a political
              stalemate with rival power centers claiming legitimacy for control
              of the country, and negotiations thus far having not produced an
              agreement on a constitutional framework that could pave the way
              toward stability and elections.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ravaged by a decade-long civil war, Syria faces monumental
              challenges in rebuilding its shattered economy. The Arab League
              this year invited Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to attend for
              the first time since the country's suspension from the bloc in
              2011 following the eruption of civil war. While diplomatic
              normalization is expected to facilitate some renewed growth and
              cross-border trade with Syria, further progress requires a
              comprehensive settlement on Syria's conflict that allows the
              return of Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, and elsewhere.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Yemen, peace negotiations are progressing, but the country
              remains one of the world's largest humanitarian crises, with
              millions lacking access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene
              services, and regular outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.
            </p>

            <p class="italic_ underline_">Challenges of Structural Reform</p>

            <p>
              While the COVID-19 pandemic and factors like the war in Ukraine
              have caused significant economic shocks worldwide, some regional
              economic stagnation can be attributed to a combination of lack of
              natural resources, stagnant economies, and structural reform
              challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Egyptian economy has maintained positive growth rates despite
              difficulties such as rising food and energy prices after the war
              in Ukraine started early last year. However, it faces slowing
              growth, food insecurity, and declining foreign investment, which
              actors like the IMF have attributed to issues like excessive state
              control on macroeconomic factors like exchange rates and
              industrial sectors that most countries have privatized. According
              to the World Bank, Egypt must pursue reforms to unleash the
              private sector's potential by addressing barriers related to
              competition, skill shortages, and structural challenges related to
              its business environment, governance and the rule of law.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Jordan, which has limited natural resources, there remains
              heavy reliance on external aid such as the more than 20 billion US
              dollars provided by the United States since 1951. The country
              continues to struggle with persistent unemployment challenges,
              including one of the region's lowest rates of women's
              participation in the labor force.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lebanon, once seen as the Paris of the Middle East due to its
              vibrant culture and social life, is now a state grappling with the
              worst multi-pronged political and economic crisis in its history,
              with inflation reaching almost 270 percent this year. According to
              the World Bank, Lebanon should urgently embark on a comprehensive
              fiscal reform strategy and, in the medium term, must work to build
              better institutions, or else the social and economic situation
              could worsen.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because of these factors, it will be difficult to facilitate
              development in some regional countries without addressing domestic
              considerations. International partners, including the IMF and
              World Bank, have called for major structural reforms to aid
              privatization, curtail public spending, and adjust monetary
              policy. Some governments like Jordan have cooperated with
              partners, and secured fiscal support for bailouts and structural
              adjustments. But domestic political obstructions remain in other
              cases. More generally, cuts to state public spending are likely to
              be socially destabilizing and place pressure on governments in
              their efforts to reform.
